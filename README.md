## Minehut.com Player-Server Plugin Repository
Public plugin repo used in the /minehut plugin menu. 

### How to Contribute
Adding a plugin is as simple as...

1. Paste in the .jar file.

2. (Optional) Paste in a pre-generated plugin folder.

3. Edit the `plugins.json` file to include your plugin. 

```
    {
		"name": "Silk Spawners",  
		"desc": "Create Custom Mob Spawners",  
		"jarName": "SilkSpawners.jar",  
		"configName": "SilkSpawners"  
	}
```

--

You can use `color codes` in the desc.
```
"desc": "&bThis will display as aqua!"
```
Putting `\n` will result in a new line.
Please be sure to create multiple lines for large descriptions.

--

In its current state, our framework does not support the practice of hard deleting plugins. To disable/remove a broken plugin, add `"disabled": true`
Example: 
```
	{	
		"name": "EchoPet",
		"desc": "EchoPet is no longer supported for 1.9+. It will not work!",
		"jarName": "EchoPet_v2.8.0.jar",
		"configName": "EchoPet_v2.8.0",
		"disabled": true
	},
```

This will remove the plugin from servers when they startup, and will hide the plugin from the plugins page of the control panel.

### Pull Requests
Pull requests should have the following things:

1. The commits should have a descriptive message and which is not in the past tense.

  For example:  
  `Describe the XYZ plugin with more detail.` or `Add config for XYZ.` is good, but: `Added XYZ.` isn't.

2. Content should be grammatically correct and the spelling should be US English, e.g. Color not Colour.
